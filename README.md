# Decoding-scripts-for-sharing
A replication of methods adopted in the classic paper: vector reconstruction for firing rates. Using simulated firing rate, I tried to decode the "direction" coded by the specific neurons of crickets. The code below can re-produce the figures in the paper. 
In order to get the graphs as efficient as possible: please run the code in blocks
Decoding methods including:
Bayesian, OLE, ML, and LS
